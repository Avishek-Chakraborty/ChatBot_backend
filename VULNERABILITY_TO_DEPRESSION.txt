Depression is not just about ‚Äúfeeling down‚Äù or ‚Äúhaving a rough patch.‚Äù There are many other aspects to know about this condition.
Loss of interest in activities you typically enjoy. Feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Physical illness. The effects of depression are extensive and vary from person to person.

Major depressive disorder is the most widespread mood disorder in the world. Also called clinical depression, or just depression, it's when you have symptoms of low mood or hopelessness for at least 2 weeks. Scientists still don't know what causes it. But they know that treating it is complex and that people who have it need more ways to feel better faster.

For about half a century, scientists have put a lot of effort into improving medications that target a small set of neurotransmitters. Those are chemicals in the brain -- serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in particular -- that affect how your nerve cells talk to each other, which then affects your mood.

Most people respond to standard antidepressants. But at least 30% of people who try two different kinds of these drugs continue to have symptoms of depression. That's called treatment-resistant depression.

So, over the past 2 decades, scientists have changed how they think about treatment for major depressive disorder as their understanding of the brain biology behind depression has changed.

The biggest change is that medication research has gone past only targeting certain neurotransmitters, says Gerard Sanacora, MD, PhD, director of the Yale Depression Research Program in New Haven, CT. "We've opened up a whole new vista of potential targets for new drugs." 

One of the best first steps to navigating depression is gaining a better understanding of the condition.

 To diagnose depression, an individual must meet certain criteria provided in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

You must have experienced a depressive episode lasting longer than 2 weeks. And at least five of the following symptoms have to be present most of the day, every day:

depressed mood
diminished interest or pleasure in activities
significant change in appetite or weight
insomnia or hypersomnia
observable agitation or decline in physical movement
loss of energy or fatigue
feelings of worthlessness, or excessive or inappropriate guilt
diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness
recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation with or without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt
For a diagnosis of depression, one of the five symptoms experienced has to be depressed mood or loss of interest.

There‚Äôs no medical test for depression. However, a lab test might be able to tell if another condition ‚Äì such as a thyroid problem or vitamin deficiency ‚Äì might be causing your symptoms.

You will likely be given a physical examination and asked a series of questions to get a better understanding of the type and severity of your symptoms.

You can take this test if you think you might be depressed. But remember that this does not replace a professional diagnosis.

Researchers have been trying to find the exact cause of depression for centuries. Although the answers are still somewhat of a mystery, we know more than ever before.

Researchers determined there are certain factors that might make you more likely to develop depression, including:

genetics
seasonal changes
personality traits
significant life changes
lack of social support or close relationships
high stress levels
underlying medical conditions such as heart attack or cancer

Serotonin is often linked with depression. One of the more popular myths is that low levels of serotonin ‚Äì a chemical in the brain responsible for mood ‚Äì causes depression.

But is there really a connection between serotonin and depression? The answer is more complicated than once thought.

Though research indicates that serotonin levels impact depression and other mood disorders, evidence explaining why isn‚Äôt concrete.

One of the major reasons serotonin is still believed to affect depression is because selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRYous) ‚Äì the most commonly prescribed medication for treating mood disorders ‚Äì work by increasing serotonin levels.

However, scientists believe that they don‚Äôt work simply because of that. They suggest that they also work because they promote neuron growth and connectivity in the brain, boosting positive emotional processing, resulting in an improved mood.

Youn other words, it‚Äôs more complex than just ramping up the amount of serotonin you have. And it‚Äôs unlikely that an imbalance of one chemical would alone be enough to cause depression.

We often use ‚Äúdepression‚Äù as a generalized term, but there are actually many types of depressive disorders. Some examples are:

Major depressive disorder
Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)
Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder
After 2013, the new DSM classified postpartum depression and seasonal affective disorder as ‚Äúspecifiers‚Äù for major depressive disorder rather than separate diagnoses.

You can be difficult to determine when normal feelings of sadness cross the line into depression. But even though being sad is a prominent symptom of depression, they are not one and the same.

One key difference is that sadness is typically brought on by a negative life event or situation, while depression can develop for no apparent reason.

Depression isn‚Äôt simply extreme sadness. Other symptoms include:

loss of appetite
feeling hopeless or pessimistic
having decreased energy
loss of interest in hobbies
having insomnia or oversleeping
Every person experiences depression differently. Not everyone lives with every symptom, and sadness alone doesn‚Äôt equal depression.

The World Health Organization estimates that 264 million people worldwide live with depression.

Yout can impact anybody, regardless of gender, race, or age. But some groups do experience depression at higher rates than others.

According to the National Younstitute of Mental Health (NYouMH), young adults ages 18-25, adult women, and people of two or more races are more likely to experience depressive episodes.

People with substance use disorder and underlying medical conditions also develop depression at higher rates.

Since no two people experience depression in the same way, every individual needs personalized treatment to get the best results.

Luckily, the options for improving symptoms of depressive disorders are plentiful. Youf one doesn‚Äôt work for you, that‚Äôs OK! Yout can take time to figure out the best plan for managing your depression.

Treatments for depression often include medications (antidepressants) or psychotherapy, or a combination of both.

Youf symptoms are severe, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) might be an option.

There are also self-help and coping tools that you can use to manage symptoms of depression, such as:

getting enough sleep
taking herbal remedies
reaching out to loved ones
avoiding alcohol and other substances
exercising regularly and getting outdoors
eating a healthy, balanced diet
Between 80 and 90% of people with depression find relief from their symptoms after treatment, so if you‚Äôre having symptoms, consider reaching out for help.

Clinical depression is a serious condition that negatively affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. In contrast to normal sadness, clinical depression is persistent, often interferes with a person‚Äôs ability to experience or anticipate pleasure, and significantly interferes with functioning in daily life. Untreated, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years; and if inadequately treated, depression can lead to significant impairment, other health-related issues, and in rare cases, suicide.

A person is diagnosed with a major depression when he or she experiences at least five of the symptoms listed below for two consecutive weeks. At least one of the five symptoms must be either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.Symptoms include:

Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day
Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities most of the day, nearly every day
Changes in appetite that result in weight losses or gains unrelated to dieting
Changes in sleeping patterns
Loss of energy or increased fatigue
Restlessness or irritability
Feelings of anxiety
Feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, or hopelessness
Inappropriate guilt
Difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions
Thoughts of death or attempts at suicide

The first step to being diagnosed is to visit a doctor for a medical evaluation. Certain medications, and some medical conditions such as thyroid disorder, can cause similar symptoms as depression. A doctor can rule out these possibilities by conducting a physical examination, interview and lab tests. If the doctor eliminates a medical condition as a cause, he or she can implement treatment or refer the patient to a mental health professional.

Once diagnosed, a person with depression can be treated by various methods. The mainstays of treatment for depression are any of a number of antidepressant medications and psychotherapy, which can also be used in combination.

For severe, treatment-resistant depression, studies have been done showing Deep Brain Stimulation may be an option.


clinical depression is a serious, but treatable, mental illness. It is a medical condition, not a personal weakness.

It is also very common. Major depression is a clinical syndrome that affects about 6.7% of the U.S. population over age 18, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Some estimate that major depression may be as high as 15%. Everybody at one point or another will feel sadness as a normal reaction to loss, grief, or injured self-esteem, but clinical depression, called "major depressive disorder" or "major depression" by doctors, is a serious medical illness that needs professional diagnosis and treatment.

 Children are subject to the same factors that cause depression in adults. These include: A change in physical health, life events, heredity, or inheritance, environment, and chemical disturbance in the brain. It is estimated that 2.5% of children in the U.S. suffer from depression. In adolescents, it is estimated to be 4% to 8%.

Depression in children is different from the "normal" blues and everyday emotions that are typical in children of various ages. Children who are depressed experience changes in their behavior that are persistent and disruptive to their normal lifestyle, usually interfering with relationships with friends, schoolwork, special interests, and family life. It may also occur at the same time as (or be hidden by) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or conduct disorder (CD).

Lack of sleep alone cannot cause depression, but it does play a role. Lack of sleep resulting from another medical illness or the presence of personal problems can intensify depression. Chronic inability to sleep is also an important clue that someone may be depressed.

Common triggers of depression include:

Family history of depression.
An abnormal reaction over the loss of a loved one through death, divorce, or separation.
Interpersonal disputes.
Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse.
Major life events such as moving, graduating or retiring, etc.
Serious illness. Major, chronic, and terminal illnesses often contribute to depression. These include cancer, heart disease, stroke, HIV, Parkinson's disease, and others.
Substance abuse. Street drugs or heavy alcohol use can cause mood changes that mimic depression or other mood disorders. In addition, some people with substance abuse problems also may have depression, bipolar disorder, or other mood problems even when they are not using mood-altering substances.
Being socially isolated or excluded from family, friends, or other social groups.

Alternative therapy describes any treatment or technique that has not been extensively scientifically documented or identified as safe or effective for a specific condition. Alternative therapy involves a variety of disciplines that include everything from diet to mental conditioning and lifestyle changes. Some of these have been found to be effective for treating depression. 

Exercise, sometimes considered an alternative treatment, has gained increasing evidence for its ability to treat mild to moderate forms of depression. 

Examples of alternative therapies include acupuncture, guided imagery, chiropractic care, yoga, hypnosis, biofeedback, aromatherapy, relaxation, herbal remedies, massage, and many others. If you are interested in trying any of these options, talk to your doctor.

Illnesses that can lead to depression are usually major, chronic, and/or terminal. When an illness is causing depression, there is often long-term pain or physical disability present or there is a sudden change in lifestyle.

Depression causes illness in a different way. Like psychological stress, it can weaken the immune system (cells involved in fighting disease and keeping you healthy), allowing a person to get more colds or the flu. There is often a notable presence of "aches and pains" with no particular cause. Having depression may also cause the symptoms of another medical illness to last longer and intensify its symptoms, but the true relationship of depression-induced illness, in terms of major disease, has not been thoroughly defined.

It is important to seek the advice of your doctor if you think you or someone you know may have depression. Your primary care doctor is a good place to start. They can screen you for depression and develop a treatment plan to help manage your symptoms.

MAOIs, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are effective antidepressant medicines that have been used for years. Typically prescribed for people with severe depression, MAOIs improve mood by increasing the number of chemicals in the brain that pass messages between brain cells. They have proven to work just as well as, if not better than, other antidepressant drugs, but they have more possible food and drug interactions.

Medicines to avoid when taking MAOIs include all SSRIs (a group of antidepressants that includes Paxil and  Prozac) and certain pain medicines, including Demerol and tramadol. There are also some cough medicines, decongestants, and blood pressure medicines that should not be taken with MAOIs. Foods to avoid when taking MAOIs include aged cheeses and meats, pickled or smoked foods like sauerkraut or meat, and aged or fermented foods such as soy sauce or tap beer. It is important to tell your doctor about any medicines you are currently taking. Be sure to discuss the limitations, interactions, and possible side effects of MAOIs.

Women develop depression twice as often as men. One reason may be the various changes in hormone levels that women experience. For example, depression is common during pregnancy and menopause, as well as after giving birth, suffering a miscarriage, or having a hysterectomy -- these are all times when women experience huge fluctuations in hormones. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), an extreme form of PMS, may also cause depression.

Most people who suffer from depression do not attempt suicide, but according to Mental Health America, 30%-70% of suicide victims have suffered from some form of depression. This figure demonstrates the importance of seeking professional treatment for yourself or someone you love if you suspect depression.

Having experienced an episode of major depression does put a person at greater risk for future episodes, but not everyone who has recovered from depression will experience it again. Sometimes depression is triggered by a major life event, illness, or a combination of factors particular to a certain place and time. Depression can also occur for no obvious ''reason." Getting the proper treatment for the correct amount of time is crucial to recovery and in helping prevent or identify any future depression.

If left untreated, various types of depressive disorders can last for months or sometimes years. A major depressive episode is characterized by a set of symptoms that typically lasts for a few months.

Seasonal depression, or SAD, usually extends throughout the winter months and continues to improve during spring and summer.

Bipolar disorder is characterized as "ups" (periods of mania) and "downs" (periods of extreme depression). Though these phases may change rapidly or slowly, bipolar depression may last until an effective treatment is found.

Dysthymia, commonly referred to as persistent depressive disorder, is a mild and sometimes less recognizable form of depression that lasts for 2 years or more in adults. It disrupts quality of life and may lead to major depression if left untreated. 

Recent numbers from the National Institute of Mental Health show that depression causes major distress and life disruption for more 63% of adults and more than 70% of teens with the disorder. Depression can also lead you to think more about or to attempt suicide.

Here‚Äôs a look at what researchers are studying now and how their work may help you if you have depression.
Fast-acting antidepressants can work in hours to help you feel better if you have depression or suicidal thoughts. The FDA in 2019 approved the first, a nasal spray called esketamine for treatment-resistant depression. A year later the FDA approved it for depression that includes suicidal thinking.

Esketamine, which you might take with a traditional antidepressant, is made from an older medication called ketamine. Doctors first used ketamine years ago as an anesthetic, a drug used to put people to sleep.

Ketamine can also rapidly improve depression but can cause serious side effects. These include out-of-body experiences and hallucinations. Some people abuse ketamine.

Esketamine can cause similar side effects and abuse problems. However, a 2021 review of studies published in Frontiers in Neuroscience reported that its effects are usually mild to moderate and don‚Äôt last long.

New Medications and Faster Results
There's a long-held idea that depression takes weeks or months to resolve. But new fast-acting treatments have "changed what we think is possible in the field," Sanacora says.   

In 2019, the FDA approved brexanolone (Zulresso). It's the first drug specifically for postpartum depression, which is a type of major depression. Experts aren't exactly sure how it works. But it's a human-made version of a steroid your body makes naturally. It affects your GABA receptors, which help regulate mood.

Brexanolone isn't as easy to take as other antidepressants. You get it through a vein in your arm at a health care facility over the course of 60 hours. But it can work quickly. Your depression symptoms might start to lift by the end of your treatment.

Another breakthrough drug came out that same year.     

Esketamine is a prescription nasal spray. The low-dose psychedelic drug boosts the activity of glutamate in parts of your brain related to mood. Glutamate's job is to excite cells in the brain and nervous system. Esketamine can trigger new connections in your brain too. You may start to see improvements in your depression within hours or days of using it, Sanacora says.

Esketamine offers lifesaving hope for people with suicidal thoughts and relief for people with treatment-resistant depression. But used alone, symptom relief may only last a couple of weeks. That's why experts agree you should take rapid-onset drugs alongside traditional treatments.

As for those with mild or moderate depression, Sanacora still first suggests cognitive behavioral therapy, followed by conventional antidepressants also known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Doctors need more information on the safety and long-term effects of newer treatments for depression.

"Over the past 20 years, we've had a transformative change in the way we treat depression," Sanacora says. "But we still have to smooth it out to understand for which patients these treatments are best and when."

Medications aren't the only treatment for depression. Electroconvulsive therapy has been around for more than 70 years. It remains one of the most effective ways to manage major depressive disorder, especially if you don't respond to other treatments. While it isn't new, scientists have fine-tuned the procedure over the past decades.

Today, electroconvulsive therapy uses less energy than it did in the past. The goal is to give you the same benefits but with less negative impact on your memory and thinking skills. "That's been a huge improvement," says Susan Conroy, MD, PhD, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Indiana University School of Medicine.

Conroy also uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to treat depression, which has fewer side effects than electroconvulsive therapy. It works by sending magnetic pulses around your skull.

Brain tissue translates these signals into electrical energy, Conroy says, which changes the way areas of your brain talk to each other. "By changing that circuitry, we think that's how transcranial magnetic stimulation gets people better from depression."

These and other forms of brain stimulation aren't right for everyone. But tell your doctor if other treatments don't help and your depression keeps you from doing daily activities, you aren't eating, and you have constant suicidal thoughts.

"These are all signs your treatment needs to be escalated and pretty quickly," Conroy says.

Esketamine can cause similar side effects and abuse problems. However, a 2021 review of studies published in Frontiers in Neuroscience reported that its effects are usually mild to moderate and don‚Äôt last long.

 doctors rely mostly on guesswork to choose your antidepressant. The latest research may give them tools that can help them pick the best treatment for individuals. Tests and tools that may cut down on trial and error in antidepressant treatment include:

Blood tests. Recent studies show blood tests that measure levels of certain proteins can predict whether particular antidepressants are likely to relieve your symptoms.

Gene tests. Tests for certain genes and how they affect your body‚Äôs response to specific drugs may help guide your doctor to the best treatment for you. In one recent study, people who took a 10-gene test to help direct treatment choice got better more often than those whose treatment was chosen without the test.

Brain imaging. Researchers are testing SPECT (single positron emission computed tomography) and PET (positron emission tomography) to see if these imaging tools can help doctors choose the right drug for you. They show activity in different areas of your brain.

A recent review of studies found that using PET to look at how the brain uses glucose, or sugar, could help predict whether an antidepressant would improve a person‚Äôs depression.

Artificial intelligence (AI) that reads brain scans. Some scientists hope to treat depression with AI programs that can find patterns in EEG (electroencephalogram) scans. These scans measure your brain‚Äôs electrical activity. A 2020 Nature Biotechnology study found that an AI program could use a person‚Äôs EEG data to predict whether the most common type of antidepressant would work for them.
New knowledge about the causes of depression could open the door to new treatments. These biological processes may play a role:

Inflammation.  Inflammation is your body‚Äôs natural defense against infections and injury. But when it happens when it shouldn‚Äôt or gets out of control it can lead to or worsen many different diseases. Depression is one of them, according to the latest research.

In the largest-ever study of depression and inflammation, published in 2021 in the American Journal of Psychiatry, scientists confirmed the link between the two. They found people with depression had more inflammation than those without the mental health disorder. This was true even after scientists accounted for other factors involved in depression.

This means that medications that lower inflammation may be helpful add-ons to antidepressant treatment. Lifestyle changes that can reduce inflammation, such as exercise and a healthy diet, may also help improve symptoms of depression.

The gut-brain connection. You‚Äôve got trillions of bacteria and microorganisms, or microbes, in your gut. Some are helpful and some can be harmful. When the balance isn‚Äôt right, it can add to health problems, including depression and inflammation.

Some of the latest research has found that probiotics, which can give you a better balance of gut microbes, may also ease symptoms of depression. Probiotics are living bacteria found in fermented foods like yogurt or in supplements. They have few side effects.

Scientists need to learn more about how probiotics work in people with depression. Some studies find they work best when you use them along with antidepressant drugs. Research also suggests different strains, or types, of probiotics may help with different symptoms of depression.

In the meantime, it‚Äôs probably safe to try a probiotic for a month to see if it improves your mood. Just don‚Äôt stop any of your prescribed medications without the OK from your doctor.

Depression is twice as common among women as among men. About 20 percent of women will experience at least one episode of depression across their lifetime. Scientists are examining many potential causes for and contributing factors to women‚Äôs increased risk for depression. Biological, life cycle, hormonal and psychosocial factors unique to women may be linked to women‚Äôs higher depression rates. Researchers have shown, for example, that hormones affect brain chemistry, impacting emotions and mood.

Before adolescence, girls and boys experience depression at about the same frequency. By adolescence, however, girls become more likely to experience depression than boys. Research points to several possible reasons for this imbalance. The biological and hormonal changes that occur during puberty likely contribute to the sharp increase in rates of depression among adolescent girls. In addition, research has suggested that girls are more likely than boys to continue feeling bad after experiencing difficult situations or events, suggesting they are more prone to depression.

Women are particularly vulnerable to depression after giving birth, when hormonal and physical changes and the new responsibility of caring for a newborn can be overwhelming. Many new mothers experience a brief episode of mild mood changes known as the ‚Äúbaby blues.‚Äù These symptoms usually dissipate by the 10th day. PPD lasts much longer than 10 days, and can go on for months following child birth. Acute PPD is a much more serious condition that requires active treatment and emotional support for the new mother. Some studies suggest that women who experience PPD often have had prior depressive episodes.

Menopause is defined as the state of an absence of menstrual periods for 12 months. Menopause is the point at which estrogen and progesterone production decreases permanently to very low levels. The ovaries stop producing eggs and a woman is no longer able to get pregnant naturally. During the transition into menopause, some women experience an increased risk for depression. Scientists are exploring how the cyclical rise and fall of estrogen and other hormones may affect the brain chemistry that is associated with depressive illness.

For older adults who experience depression for the first time later in life, other factors, such as changes in the brain or body, may be at play. For example, older adults may suffer from restricted blood flow, a condition called ischemia. Over time, blood vessels become less flexible. They may harden and prevent blood from flowing normally to the body‚Äôs organs, including the brain. If this occurs, an older adult with no family or personal history of depression may develop what some doctors call ‚Äúvascular depression.‚Äù Those with vascular depression also may be at risk for a coexisting cardiovascular illness, such as heart disease or a stroke.

Researchers are looking for ways to better understand, diagnose and treat depression among all groups of people. Studying strategies to personalize care for depression, such as identifying characteristics of the person that predict which treatments are more likely to work, is an important goal.

The ability of ketamine to produce a rapid and efficacious antidepressant response by a completely novel mechanism is considered by many experts the most important finding in the depression field in 50 years. Originally developed as an anesthetic, ketamine is an antagonist of the NMDA receptor on a subset of brain cells. It often produces rapid (within hours) antidepressant actions in patients who have failed to respond to conventional antidepressants (i.e., are considered treatment-resistant). Ketamine is psychoactive and has potentially dangerous side effects; it has a past history of being abused as a street drug. Studies aimed at characterizing the mechanisms by which ketamine works rapidly and effectively in severely depressed individuals is likely to lead to novel targets and agents that are safer and more long-lasting, and could revolutionize the treatment of depression. Numerous BBRF Grants support this work, including a number that are attempting to develop ketamine analogs ‚Äì compounds that act like ketamine but lack its side-effects.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a term used in clinical psychiatry to describe cases of major depressive disorder that do not respond to standard treatments (at least two courses of antidepressant treatments). For many people, antidepressant treatment and/or ‚Äòtalk‚Äô therapy (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) ease symptoms of depression, but with treatment-resistant depression, little to no relief is realized. Treatment-resistant depression symptoms can range from mild to severe and may require trying a number of approaches to identify what helps. (Source: Biological Psychiatry)

Treatment of resistant depression has most commonly been treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT has been modified to avoid the pain previously associated with it and is the most effective and quick-acting treatment for resistant depression. The downside is that it works by inducing brain seizures and can impair memory. Its therapeutic benefits can also fade over time. New methods of brain stimulation also offer the possibility of relief. These technologies exploit the fact that the brain is an electrical organ: it responds to electrical and magnetic stimulation to modulate brain circuits and change brain activity. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), pioneered by Dr. Mark George with the support of NARSAD grants, was approved by the FDA in 2008 as a treatment for some otherwise untreatable depressions. rTMS is a noninvasive method that works through a coil held over the target area of the brain. A magnetic field passes through the skull to activate the appropriate brain circuit and no seizures are induced. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), a technique adapted for treating depression by Dr. Helen Mayberg with the support of NARSAD grants, works through electrodes planted deep in the brain. Another method, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), stimulates the vagus nerve in the neck to therapeutically activate brain function. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) combines rTMS and ECT to achieve a safer form of seizure therapy. MST has been supported through NARSAD Grants to Dr. Sarah Lisanby. Recently, Foundation grantees at the University of Pittsburgh have successfully experimented on a small number of patients with treatment-resistant depression, discovering underlying metabolic deficiencies and successfully treating these. In one subset of patients, a deficiency in cerebral folate was addressed by administering folinic acid. Patients‚Äô depression symptoms declined significantly when these metabolic problems were treated. For some individuals, depression reached remission.

The first attempts at defining depression as a biologically-based illness hinged on a theory of a ‚Äòchemical imbalance‚Äô in the brain. It was thought that too much or too little of essential signal-transmitting chemicals‚Äîneurotransmitters‚Äîwere present in the brain. This idea has been useful‚Äîthat the brain is a kind of chemical soup in which there may be too much dopamine or too little serotonin, but it is now begin replaced by much more sophisticated knowledge about how the brain works, made possible by basic research. All the current antidepressants were developed during the period when the chemical-soup theory was in vogue. But now, many researchers are looking to understand in greater detail the brain biology that underlies depression‚Äôs symptoms so that novel therapies can be found.

Throughout this website you will find ideas for new depression treatments in greater detail. Efforts to create new classes of antidepressants, based on novel targets have borne fruit. A docking port on brain cells called the mu opioid receptor is the focus of one such effort. Other efforts focus not on the serotonin pathway, as do current ‚ÄúSSRI‚Äù drugs such as Prozac, but another pathway, that of another key neurotransmitter, called glutamate. A previously obscure brain area called the lateral habenula may be involved in depression pathology in some instances, due to glutamate hyperactivity. A drug able to specifically lower the activity in that region is a plausible drug discovery objective. Other researchers have been working on the idea that drugs that can mimic the biochemical and biological factors rendering certain people resilient to factors such as severe or chronic stress may have a future in depression treatment. A drug is now being tested that in preliminary trials has helped to reduce postpartum depression. Other researchers have been studying the ability to help women resist depression in the perinatal period through hormone treatments, or, in other work, via treatments that target the maternal immune system, which may be implicated in a subset of postpartum depression. Research has begun to see if administering certain strains of bacteria in depressed individuals might give a boost to their immune system and help reduce depression symptoms. Trying to alleviate depression via changes in diet ‚Äì e.g., a Mediterranean diet, in one recent study ‚Äì or omega-3 (‚Äúfish oil‚Äù) supplements is the subject of other Foundation-supported research. Yet another path that may lead to better outcomes in the future is bright-light therapy, which was first used to help people with seasonal affective disorder. It may have wider applications. It is also important to note research by grantees that has suggested the ability of even a short course of talk therapy to help alleviate depression in mothers with major depression, while at the same time helping their children. Such therapy worked best when it focused on the mother‚Äôs relationship with her child, the research revealed.

Dr. J. John Mann presented a webinar titled: Brain Plasticity: The Effects of Antidepressants on Major Depression in which he discusses why we need to better understand how antidepressants including SSRIs, lithium, and ketamine exert their therapeutic effects, so we can find newer more effective and rapidly acting treatments for depression:

Brain imaging has confirmed the biological nature of many psychiatric illnesses over the past twenty years. Yvette Sheline, M.D., in the mid-1990s, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify structural brain changes in depressed patients and established depression as a brain disease.

Using positron emission tomography (PET) scan images, Dr. Helen Mayberg of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, identified, in 2013, specific brain activity that can potentially predict whether people with major depressive disorder will best respond to an antidepressant medication or psychotherapy. This important new work offers a first potential imaging biomarker for treatment selection. A team of researchers including NARSAD Grantee Stefan G. Hoffman, Ph.D., of Boston University and Frida E. Polli, Ph.D., of Massachusetts Institute of Technology have used brain imaging to predict the success of cognitive behavioral therapy, a specific type of talk therapy often used to help treat a wide range of mental illnesses including anxiety disorders, depression, and schizophrenia.  Research by Dr. Conor Liston of Weill Cornell Medical School, and colleagues, has used brain scans to identify four distinct ‚Äúbiotypes‚Äù of depression. Strikingly, patients in one of these four categories were about three times more likely to respond to a noninvasive treatment known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) than patients in two of the other categories. This is a good example of the power that biomarkers can have in the years just ahead to help direct people with depression to treatments most likely to help them.

Variations in genes ‚Äì different kinds of DNA mutations, both common and rare ‚Äì have been solidly linked to a number of serious psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. It is reasonable to wonder why similar progress has not been made yet in the study of the genetic factors contributing to depression. Researchers have made many attempts to search for such factors, but have not come up with results that statisticians consider ‚Äústatistically meaningful.‚Äù One way of explaining the issue in studying depression concerns that very large number of people whom it affects. The power of massive genomic studies of patients (who are compared with unaffected individuals) evaporates if the people being compared have similar illnesses that have very different underlying genetic profiles. People with major depression might be grouped according to sex; whether or not they have recurrent depression; age at onset; symptom patterns; whether or not they were abused or under chronic stress early in life, for example. There is very good reason for progress on the genetic front, however. Foundation grantee Patrick Sullivan, M.D. and others have had success in finding the first reliable signals of commonly seen genetic variations in people with schizophrenia. To do so, they need to assemble a patient sample, across continents, numbering in the tens of thousands. They founded the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium to accomplish this. PGC scientists estimate that the inflection point in depression studies may be 75,000 to 100,000 study participants, a goal the PGC is working toward. It‚Äôs not that there is no genetic signal in depression, in other words. It‚Äôs a question of assembling a well-documented sample of patients of sufficient size to ‚Äútease out‚Äù the embedded genetic ‚Äúsignals,‚Äù which will point toward risk genes for the illness.

While 1 in 5 people will experience a diagnosable mental health condition in their lives, 5 out of 5 people will go through a challenging time that affects their mental health. There are simple things that every person can say or do to help the people in their life who are struggling to get through the tough times.

This worksheet from Mental Health America‚Äôs 2020 Mental Health Month Toolkit can help you think about how to start this conversation.

Here are some more tips on how to talk to someone about their mental health:

Practice active listening.
Active listening is different than just hearing what a person has to say. A good active listener:

puts everything aside and gives their complete attention to the person who is talking
asks open-ended questions to get more details about the topic that is being discussed (‚ÄúAnd how did that make you feel?‚Äù)
takes moments throughout the conversation to summarize what they‚Äôve been told and make sure they are understanding clearly
Don‚Äôt compare.
If a friend or loved-one is going through a tough situation and they come to you for support, you might feel tempted to tell them about something that happened to you and how you were able to get through it. It‚Äôs okay to share about similar experiences, but be careful not to compare. It can make someone feel like their pain isn‚Äôt valid. For instance, if they are telling you about a breakup, don‚Äôt mention how you had a much harder divorce. Focus on what you did to cope with feelings of loss or loneliness.

Ask what you can do.
It can be tempting to assume what would be helpful to someone who is struggling, but it‚Äôs always better to ask them what they need from you. If you ask and get a response like, ‚Äúnothing, I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù offer up a few suggestions for things you would be willing to do (without being pushy). For instance, you could offer to come sit with them and watch a movie, cook them a meal, or pick up a few things for them at the store.

Keep your word.
If you have offered your support to someone and told them you would do something, keep your word. When a person is struggling, the last thing they need is to feel abandoned by someone else. If you absolutely can‚Äôt honor your promise, make a sincere apology and find another time that you can do what you said you would.

Don‚Äôt judge.
To be truly supportive of someone, you need to put your personal opinions and biases aside. They may be struggling because of a mistake that they made, or you may think that they are overreacting, but you will never know what it is truly like to be that person in this moment, and criticism is not helpful to their recovery.

Offer to join them.
When someone is going through a time of sadness or uncertainty, their emotions can take over and leave them feeling paralyzed and unable to take care of life‚Äôs obligations. Offering to go with someone to help them take care of responsibilities like walking the dog, going to the grocery store, attending doctor appointments, or picking up the dry cleaning can help them feel a sense of accomplishment and lift their spirits.

Know when more serious help is needed.

if you think someone that you care about is struggling it can be hard to start a conversation with them about what is going on in their life. If a 
face-to-face talk is too intimidating, you can start with a text messsage or an email.
 Use the prompts below to help you think through what speci cally has happened, or what you‚Äôve noticed about your friend or loved one that has 
caused you to be concerned about them. 
Start the conversation when there is an open window of time to have an in-depth discussion, and you won‚Äôt have to cut the conversation short to take 
care of other obligations. Plan to set aside at least 30 minutes to an hour.

Future Treatment
Lots of other promising treatments for depression are on the horizon. Deep brain stimulation is one. In this treatment, a surgeon implants electrodes in your brain. These nodes send painless zaps that alter the electrical activity that's causing your symptoms.

You can think of this treatment kind of like a pacemaker for your mood. While it's not approved for the general public, it might be soon. "Technology is advancing really quickly," Conroy says.

Researchers are also studying a drug called SAGE-217. Sanacora says there's interest in how it might help prevent a serious relapse in people with a history of depression. The idea is that you'd take it as soon as your symptoms come back. "But you don't wait until the symptoms are full-blown," he says.

There's also a lot of buzz around drugs like psilocybin. Studies show these "magic mushrooms" can ease depression about as fast as ketamine -- what esketamine is made from -- with effects that may last longer. But when it comes to psychedelics, Sanacora says, "We need a lot more research before we can say anything with confidence."

In his 25 years in the field, Sanacora says he's never seen such excitement around treatments for depression. But that doesn't mean researchers have all the answers or that major depressive disorder has a cure.

Still, you can take steps now to ease depression or guard against a relapse. That might include medication, different kinds of talk therapy, regular exercise, a good social life, and a healthy sleep routine. You should be doing "all the things we know you can do to protect yourself as much as possible," Sanacora says.
